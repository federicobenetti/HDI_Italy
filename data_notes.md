# Notes on useful datasets
## Dimensions
### Health / longevity
- Life expectancy at birth
- mortality rate (infant, under-5)
- morbidity indicators (e.g. prevalence of chronic disease)
- number of hospital beds per capita
- access to health services

Most of data data in here: https://demo.istat.it/tavole/?t=indicatori
Life expectancy is commonly used; however getting it at provincial level may require aggregation or modelled estimates

### Education / knowledge
- Mean years of schooling (for population ≥ 25);
- expected years of schooling (for children entering school);
- proportion with tertiary education;
- school completion rate;
- literacy rate

Some of these (like “expected years of schooling”) may not be directly available at province level; you may need proxies

### Standard of living / income
- GDP (or GVA) per capita at province level;
- disposable income per capita;
- unemployment rate;
- share of population below poverty line;
- relative poverty rate;
perhaps housing indicator	GDP per capita is a standard choice; disposable income is more directly linked to welfare

## Optional / supplementary dimensions (to refine the index)

### Infrastructure
- access to broadband
- public transport;
- 
### environmental quality
- air pollution
- green spaces);

### social inclusion
- income inequality Gini
- unemployment among youth
- gender gaps);
- digital access;
- housing quality

These can help better discriminate across provinces, but you must be consistent in coverage and availability
